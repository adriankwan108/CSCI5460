Virtual Reality

HW1 is an AR mobile application,
it was workable by the time of that semester,
but now find broken after I test it again.
The apk would not be upload as it is too simple.

The project is an one-man project,
which is a VR zombie escape game.
But it is in editor mode,
I cannot build it for some strange bugs,
someday in the future (after my developing ARPG) I will polish and build the game,
and post it on my website and steam store.

*Results*
<pre>
HW1:            16 / 20      (As not strictly follow the spec, which my version has an indicator for ground checking) 
Survey Report:  68 /100
Final Project:    ?          (This should have a pretty high score as the overall is A- while my survey report is not OK.)

Overall result:   A-
