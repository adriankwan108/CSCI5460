Virtual Reality

**HW1**
<pre>
HW1 is an AR mobile application,
it was workable by the time of that semester,
but now find broken after I test it again.
The apk would not be upload as it is too simple.
</pre>

**Project**
<pre>
The project is an one-man project, decided by student.
My project is a VR zombie escape game. The gameplay and functions are described in the ppt and report.
But it is only playable in editor mode, I cannot build it for some strange graphic bugs.
Therefore, the whole project will not be put on github (and it is too big due to some 4K texture).
Someday in the future (after my developing ARPG) I will polish and build the game,
and post it on my website and steam store.

*Results*

Survey Report:  68 /100
Final Project:    ?       (This should have a pretty high score as the overall is A- while my survey report is not OK.)

Overall result:   A-
